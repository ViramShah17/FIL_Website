<div style="display:inline;"><a class="anchorsection" name="about"><h2>ABOUT&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2></a></div><br/><br/>
Frugal innovation is a process of problem solving—and a game-changing strategy—that addresses the need for products and services in emerging, underdeveloped countries. Features of frugal innovation include ruggedization, simplification, sparing use of low-cost raw materials, an emphasis on earth-friendly practices, and a philosophy that favors “doing more with less” in creating compassionate, user-centric design.<br/><br/>
Emerging markets—consumers who are quickly moving out of poverty in nations such as China, Africa, India, and Brazil— are expected to account for 70 percent of the world’s economic growth over the next few years. Today’s emerging markets comprise 50 percent of the market for Fortune 500s, generating close to 50 percent of their revenues.<br/><br/>
Frugal innovation is strongly tied to social justice, but it’s not just about students doing good. It is a holistic approach that is at the intersection of altruism with the bottom line. As these technologies find their way to the mature markets of the West, they will fundamentally reshape the global economy.<br/><br/>
With the vibrancy of emerging-market growth, the School of Engineering’s Frugal Innovation Lab (FIL) meets this new paradigm head-on by offering undergraduate and graduate courses, hosting student and faculty research projects, and partnering with field-based social entrepreneurs in emerging markets. Impactful work is being done in simple yet powerful ways. Projects range from designs and prototypes to implemented and utilized products and services. Students learn within the lab as well as interact with field-based social entrepreneurs and global partners to solve real-world problems.

<div style="display:inline;"><a class="anchorsection" name="mission"><h2>MISSION&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2></a></div><br/><br/>
Sponsored by the School of Engineering, the mission of the Frugal Innovation Lab (FIL) is to develop accessible, affordable, adaptable and appropriate technologies, products and solutions for emerging markets.  FIL fosters collaboration between students, social entrepreneurs, corporate partners and faculty to incubate and scale development projects in areas such as clean energy, global health, mobile technologies, and sustainable livelihood development.

<div style="display:inline;"><a class="anchorsection" name="approach"><h2>APPROACH&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2></a></div><br/><br/>
The Frugal Innovation Lab operates in the context of the Silicon Valley, at the nexus of technology, innovation and entrepreneurship. FIL is in a unique position to take advantage of interdisciplinary academic collaborations, Silicon Valley corporate partnerships, and lasting relationships with established social entrepreneurs to provide both academic and practical experience to students passionate about FIL’s mission.

<br/><br/><br/><br/>
FIL joins together three programmatic elements to form its core: <b>Instruction, Innovation, and Immersion</b>. Undergraduate and graduate engineering, business, law, and humanities students have the opportunity to take courses offered by faculty with diverse expertise in topic areas such as Engineering for the Developing World, Mobile Applications and Programming for Emerging Markets, and Technologies in Public Health.<br/><br/>
Courses offered by FIL are informed by a network of global social entrepreneurs that offer their field-based insight to guide students in their studies and provide real world challenges for project teams to address. <i>Innovative technologies and solutions</i> that are developed by the students as a result of projects from FIL courses are then implemented in the field by the students themselves. Project teams then venture on an <i>immersion trip</i> to deliver and implement the solutions that they have engineered, where they have the opportunity to redesign their prototypes after they have been exposed to the cultural, societal, and resource implications of their particular project challenge.
